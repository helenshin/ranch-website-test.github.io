# Hi! Nice to meet you. 
We are Smiling Hogshead Ranch, all volunteer-run, urban farm in Long Island City. Our mission is to create a culture which empowers and connects our communities through ecology, education, and collaboration. 

## Our Awesome Volunteers
We are especially excited for community work days under the sun, a lush green garden filled with crops that hail from cultures around the globe, and the sights and sounds of butterflies, bees, birds, and the occasional groundhog. 

## Our Board Members
In 2011, a group of Long Island City neighbors created a “guerilla garden” on a set of abandoned railroad tracks. 
That’s a nice way of saying we didn’t have permission. When we got caught, we worked with the MTA to secure a lease and become a real-live non-profit.

### Gil Lopez
An environmental educator and landscape designer, Gil helped establish the garden in 2011, he enjoys riding his bicycle in the city and his favorite crop are the white raspberries.

### Mia Roy
Ranch co-founder and advocate of planting things that bloom; her favorite crop is whichever one is ready right now.

### Michelle Arvin
Michelle moved to NYC in 2005 and has been hanging on things ever since, mostly from her partners in La Cage Trio.  Michelle fills her free time with gardening, knitting, cooking, and her biggest adventure yet- being a mama.

### Rose Moon
Stumbled upon the Ranch shortly after moving to NYC from FL in 2012; a failed academic, Rose now spends her days homemaking, child-rearing, and community organizing. Her favorite things to grow are flowers & herbs.

### Christopher McHale
Chris has been volunteering at the farm since 2012.
He is more interested in the people and community that has grown around the Ranch than the actual plants.

### Jennie Plewka
Jennifer is an experienced and innovative educator whose passions for gardening and teaching about food have combined with her background in environmental science, horticulture, and sustainability to enrich the lives of countless children, seniors, international refugees, and people in need.

### Annabelle Meunier
Annabelle is an urban planner, environmental advocate, artist and activist who enjoys puppets, parties, outdoor activities and participatory art. She learned of the Ranch thanks to Gil, who taught her in a green infrastructure class. You can sometimes find her picking herbs to cook with.
